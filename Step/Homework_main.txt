The case came to court, and Ross and Ben were tried.
The trial did not last very long.
Ross and Ben both pleaded not guilty in court.
Their lawyer did her best to defend them, but the prosecuting lawyer produced a very strong case against them.
After brief deliberations, the jury passed verdict on them.
They decided that Ross was guilty, and he was convicted of robbery, but Ben was innocent.
The judge acquitted Ben of any involvement in the robbery, but sentenced Ross to three years in prison/jail.
As well as a prison sentence, Ross also had to pay a large fine.
Ross served two years in prison, but was released from prison a year early.
He got time off for good behaviour
